11. Explanation about VIM
 
Exploring VIM

Different options used in vim

modes :-> Insert & Escape

i --> insert mode
shift+a --> append mode
x--> delete a single charecter
dd --> deletes a complet line
p --> paste the copied line
yy --> copies the line
e --> move one word by word
/ --> search for patterns
n --> gives the next word
N --> Helps to search in reverse order
0 --> moves starting of the line
^ --> moves starting for the line
$ --> moves end of the line
G --> moves last line in the file
: se nu --> shows the numbers in the file
:%s/USER/SHAHAN  --> subtitution
w --> helps to writes the content to the file
wq! --> write & quit
q! --> quit & overwrite


Monitoring:
12.  vmstat, ping, top

13. What is memory & cache memory (real & swap) explanation 



14. user administration 

1. user add 
2. user del
3. important configuration files
4. chage

-d, --lastday LAST_DAY       
-E, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE 
-h, --help                   
-I, --inactive INACTIVE      
                             
-l, --list                   
-m, --mindays MIN_DAYS       
                             
-M, --maxdays MAX_DAYS       
                             
-W, --warndays WARN_DAYS     

5. gpasswd
6. common issues on user administration 
7. special permissions & related files
/var/log/wtmp
/etc/passwd
/etc/group
/etc/shadow
/etc/login.defs


15 Standard Partition:

Partions & management of partitions

Partion types (primary,extended,logical)

1. what is partion and why we are going for partions
2. File system & what is it importance
3. what type of file systems are there & their importance
4. creating a file system & mounting it on a directory
5. creating & deleteing the partions 
6. fdisk utility & respective options


16. Working With LVM

scanning a new lun
creating partition
creating PV
creating vg
creating lv
creating File system
mount a file system
File system increase
----

umounting a file system
removing lv
removing pv
removing vg


17. Package management:

what is package
how to install the package --> rpm,yum
how to mount the iso image
rpm -ivh
rpm -qa
rpm -qi
rpm -qc --> gives the configuration files
rpm -qd --> document files
rpm -qf --> configuration files
rpm -e pkgname --> removes the pkg


18. what is YUM
Yum configuration
installing pkg
deleting a pkg
information of pkg
listing pkg
listing repo
cleaning repo
reinstall a pkg

configuring nfs & httpd

19. More topics:
Runlevels
0	Halt the system.
1	Single-user mode (for special administration).
2	Local Multiuser with Networking but without network service (like NFS)
3	Full Multiuser with Networking
4	Not Used
5	Full Multiuser with Networking and X Windows(GUI)
6	Reboot.

Booting Process
Server accessability
password less login and configuring 
Network Configuration:
Hostname 
how to configure the adapter 
assing the ip address 
tools used to see the adapter details
ethtool,ifconfig,netstat,nslookup,ping,scp,
